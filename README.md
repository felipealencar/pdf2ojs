# PDF2OJS

One Paragraph of project description goes here
PDF2OJS is a java tool for extract metadata and content from scientific
articles. This tool analyses the content of a PDF file and attempts to extract
information such as:

* Title of the article
* Journal information (title, etc.)
* Bibliographic information (volume, issue, page numbers, etc.)
* Authors and affiliations
* Keywords
* Abstract
* Bibliographic references

This tool was original design to extract from the Brazilian Computational
Society (SBC) template. As a future work, I would like to add the IEEE
template.
